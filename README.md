# Simple-Linear-Regression-for-Salary-Data
# Predicting_Salary_using_simple_Linear_Regression
The main focus of the project is to predicting salary using simple linear regression,The inputs we consider is YearsExperiencs,Salary.The type of the model is simple linear regression,The evaluation metrics used are mean squared error,r2_score.
Step-1:# import all the lib
Step-2:# read the dataset using pandas
Step-3:# This displays the top 5 rows of the data
Step-4:# Provides some information regarding the columns in the data
Step-5:# this describes the basic stat behind the dataset used 
Step-6:# These Plots help to explain the values and how they are scattered
Step-7:# Cooking the data
Step-8:# Cooking the data
Step-9:# Import Segregating data from scikit learn
Step-10:# Split the data for train and test 
Step-11:# Create new axis for x column
Step-12:# Importing Linear Regression model from scikit learn
Step-13:# Fitting the model
Step-14:# Predicting the Salary for the Test values
Step-15:# Plotting the actual and predicted values
Step-16:# plotting the error
Step-17:# Importing metrics for the evaluation of the model
Step-18:# calculate Mean square error
Step-19:# Calculate R square vale
Step-20:# Just plot actual and predicted values for more insights
Step-21:# Intecept and coeff of the line
These are the steps are used to done the project
